    <h3>Java: Game project</h3>
    <p>
	City Escape is a Dystopian platform game that I developed as part of my Programming in Java
module to first year . it uses a simple Physics Library which allows a programmer to create and simulate 2Dworlds. The world can be populated by bodies with diverse shapes and appearances, create soundscapes, and adding
custom keyboard and mouse interactions.

My game demonstrates a player that navigates from platform to platform aiming to travel to different dimensions. The character is controlled  via the keyboard and mouse. the player can jump up and down and move side to side. 

The Player can also pick up collectibles  and gain points as shown on the top left of the game. Picking up Hearts will extend a the players life andThrowing a bomb when encountering an enemy will destroy them. But you have to be careful as it can destroy the player too.   Once all collectable are collected. The player can enter the door and travel to the next dimension.

The game features a background sound track and sounds for different game events such as pickups,
and hearts and  when encountering enemies. Visual elements such the amount of life and collectable are displayed to ensure the player is well informed. 

Iâ€™ve also implemented a Gui which allows the player to go to the next level, toggle with the setting by muting and using background sounds. and toggle back to exit the game.
